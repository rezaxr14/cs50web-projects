CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - Project Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains all my project submissions for Harvard University's CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.

This course provided a comprehensive introduction to modern web development, starting from front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and moving to back-end development with Python, Django, and SQL.
